# Task-Scheduler
The Smart Task Scheduler is a user-friendly desktop application built using Java and Swing. It allows users to create tasks with attributes like title, priority, and deadline. The application employs a priority queue to sort tasks and visually distinguishes overdue and upcoming tasks using color highlights. Users can filter tasks by due date or priority, search tasks, and sort them based on deadlines. All tasks are saved to a local file, ensuring persistence across sessions. This project demonstrates effective use of Java collections, file handling, GUI design, and logic implementation to solve real-world productivity challenges.
